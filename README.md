## About
Defcord is a multiplayer, discord application based game.

You play as a leader of a nation and it is your responsibility to make good decisions based on the information given to you.

You should make sure all of your vital attributes stay positive.

You can't know what vital attributes increase/decrease for the given information for the decision you make because you know, people are complex.

Whoever stays alive till the end of the game is the survivor of the game. If multiple people survive they are also survivors.

The main goal is to make sure you won't run out of your vital attributes in order to survive.

- Loyalty       (default: 50)
